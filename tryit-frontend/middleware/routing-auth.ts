 * It checks that the path is a valid construction of the path
 * EXAMPLES
 * compareUrl("/", "/") => true

 * compareUrl("/event/12312/error", "/event/:id") => false
 * compareUrl("/event/12312/error", "/event/:id/error") => true
 * compareUrl("/event", "/event/:id") => false

/*
 * WHY
 * Nuxt generates routes automatically. It doesn't allow you to create your own routes.
 * This pages has some routes that needs to be disabled depending on the time of the year (in August you shouldn't be able to get a ticket, for example)
 * The way of solving this problem is with this middleware. We have a routing array, where we have a boolean for each path and we select which one we want to
 * enable and which ones not. This allows us in the future to send that array via API so we don't need to modify the frontend at all.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * This function takes the current path of the browser and then checks if the path is supposed to be visible for the user. For that it checks the routes array.
 *
 * NOTE: If the path is not in the automatic routes array generated by nuxt, then it will load automatically notFound page (see nuxt.config.ts)
